---Explain your baseline in words---


The baseline chosen for this project was to compare the TIMEX3 entities produced by a different system (HeidelTime) than the one used in our project (SUTime).  Heidel time was developed at Heidelberg University, like SUTime it extracts temporal expressions into the TIMEX3 format.  

(Option 1)
An output list of SUTime Objects was compared to an output list from HeidelTime.   

(Option 2)
Similar to how SUTime was used, we generated T6 Entities from the list of HeidelTime Entities and computed results from the AnaforaTools.

---Explain your evaluation metric---

Based on the results (SUTime/HeidelTime) performed better in (producing a list of TIMEX3 Expressions)/(generating the best Anafora output).  

---Put your results and the baseline results in a table---
