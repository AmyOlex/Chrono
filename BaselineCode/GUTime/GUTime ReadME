Info about GUTime code.
Our GUTime baseline program can be run with the following command in the terminal - 
python task_6_baseline.py -i ./data/SemEval-Task6_GUTime-Data -o .data/SemEval-Task6-Baseline-GUTime-Results

Similar to our main implentation, it reads in all of the files located at the '-i' argument.

Next, it searches through the input files and extracts all of the TIMEX3 expressions and builds a list of them.

It also searches for the corresponding line that holds the actual value for the text.  

Once all of this information is extracted, it builds a list of GUTime Entities (which is very similar to our SUTime Entity implementation)

Once the entity list is instructed, it converts it into a T6List by running it through the parsing functions of GUTime_To_T6.py.

Finally, a list of T6 entities is outputed to the specified output ('-o') directory.
