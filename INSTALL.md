### Streamlined Steps:

#### 1. Check versions
Java version:
``` bash
>> java -version
```

Python version:
``` bash
>> python
```

#### 2. Download and unzip project.

#### 3. Install pip:
``` bash
>> sudo apt-get install python-pip
```

#### 4. Install additional python modules
Install nltk:
``` bash
>> pip install nltk
```

Install python-dateutil:
``` bash
>> pip install python-dateutil
```

Install word2number:
``` bash
>> pip install word2number
```

Install sutime:
``` bash
>> pip install sutime
```

#### 5. Install SUTime Dependencies
Get python-sutime from Git, cd into the directory, then run maven:
``` bash
>> git clone https://github.com/FraBle/python-sutime.git
>> cd python-sutime
>> mvn dependency:copy-dependencies -DoutputDirectory=./jars
```

While in the "python-sutime" folder:
* Move the "./jars" folder to the top level of "CMSC516-SemEval2018-Task6-master/".
* Move the "./sutime" folder to "CMSC516-SemEval2018-Task6-master/task6/".

#### 6. Debugging

* If you get a java.lang.RuntimeException: Class edu.stanford.nlp.python.SUTimeWrapper not found error, then jpype is
pointing to the wrong Java JDK library.  Delete all except 1.8 and it should run.
* If you get a Reflections error then you need to try and re-install SUTime as there are some dependencies not linked correctly.
* TensorFlow will give you some warnings but should still work, this is normal
