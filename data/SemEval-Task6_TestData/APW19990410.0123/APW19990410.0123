Rifle Found Near Dead Doctor's Home





AMHERST, N.Y. (AP) --

A rifle found near the home of a slain abortion doctor may yield important clues for investigators trying to track down the gunman.

Dr. Barnett Slepian was killed in his kitchen by a sniper's bullet last fall. Investigators said Friday they found a rifle buried near his home in the Buffalo suburb of Amherst.

The gun was sent to the FBI laboratory in Washington to determine whether it was used to kill Slepian.

``If it's not too badly rusted, they may be able to match the bullet back to the weapon,'' said Walter Rowe, forensics sciences professor at George Washington University.

The rifle might also have clothing fibers, fingerprints or a serial number that can be traced to the buyer, Rowe said.

Buried a foot beneath the ground, the weapon was unearthed during a search of a heavily wooded, four-acre area Thursday. Investigators did not say how close the weapon was to the house.

Anti-abortion protester James Kopp is being sought as a material witness in the shooting.

Investigators said Kopp's car was seen in the neighborhood in the days before the slaying. Kopp vanished after the shooting, and the car was found abandoned at the Newark, N.J., airport in December.

Officials said DNA test results showed a likelihood that a strand of hair discovered behind Slepian's home came from Kopp.
