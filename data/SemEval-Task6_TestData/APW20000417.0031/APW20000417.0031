MIAMI (AP) --

After a weekend of bitter accusations lobbed by both sides of the Elian Gonzalez custody battle, attention returned today to the federal judges deciding a key point in the international case.

The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has been asked by the U.S. government to suspend a ruling by one of its judges that prevents the removal of Elian from the country.

Such a decision would allow the U.S. government to push for the 6-year-old boy's swift reunion in Washington with his waiting father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who wants to return to Cuba. He has said he will wait out appeals by the Miami relatives seeking an asylum hearing for Elian before the same court -- but only if he has custody of his son.

There was growing apprehension outside the Little Havana home where the boy has lived with his great-uncle for nearly five months.

''The feeling is the Clinton administration might send federal agents to pull him out of here,'' said Sergio Navarro, a 39-year-old Miami businessman who spent part of Sunday night with chanting protesters.

Elian's relatives have cared for him since November, when he was found clinging to an inner tube in the Florida Straits. His mother and 10 other people fleeing Cuba drowned when their boat sank.

The Clinton administration has pushed for the boy's return to his father, ruling only he can speak for his son on immigration matters. The boy's Miami relatives say he will have a better life here and have attempted to portray Juan Miguel Gonzalez as a pawn of Fidel Castro.

The Justice Department wants the appeals court to suspend the temporary injunction issued Thursday and also order Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, to release the boy. The relatives want the court to let them meet with Elian's father without being required to surrender the boy.

The court watch comes after one of the most bitter charges yet in the custody battle.

Juan Miguel Gonzalez lashed out at his Miami relatives Sunday night, accusing them of ''child abuse'' for turning his son against him. He said they have manipulated his son to believe that his mother still may show up someday -- in this country.

''This is child abuse and mistreatment, what they're doing to this boy,'' Gonzalez said on CBS's ''60 Minutes.'' ''The way they're abusing him, turning him against his father ... he's suffering more here amongst them than he suffered in the sea.''

Gonzalez said he didn't believe a much-publicized video taped at the relatives' home in which his son said he didn't want to go. He has spoken with Elian at least three times since he arrived in the United States on April 6, and he insisted his son wants to return to Cuba.

''He's told me so,'' Gonzalez said. The Miami relatives are ``putting a bunch of toys in front of a 6-year-old. He cannot decide for himself. The one that decides for him is me, his father.''

Elian's Miami relatives have filed affidavits alleging Gonzalez abused his former wife and his 6-year-old son, a charge Gonzalez denied. During the time of the broadcast on Sunday, family members and Elian were outside the home of Lazaro Gonzalez and did not publicly comment after the show.

Protesters, however, dismissed Juan Miguel's comments as either selfish or the words of Fidel Castro.

''Fidel Castro is claiming the son, not him,'' said Olga Coto, 56, of Miami. ''He's being manipulated totally by Fidel Castro. He's not telling the truth.''

Many worried their efforts to keep the boy in Miami would fail today, the 39th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, an aborted invasion of Cuba by CIA-trained exiles that left much bitterness among the Cuban-American community.

''We were betrayed by the government, by (President) Kennedy, and if they turned the child back over, it will be a second betrayal,'' said Josefa Gonzalez, who left Cuba in 1962 when she was 4.

Earlier Sunday, protesters prayed for divine help as Easter week began, waving palm fronds and posters of the Cuban boy and Jesus. Priests joined the crowd to offer a religious service.

''There are many people who tell us that we should give up this fight,'' said Martin Anorga, an evangelical pastor. ''But we will follow in the path that the Lord has shown us, despite those who want to get in our way.''
