Clinton Vows to Hunt Down Embassy Bombers





WASHINGTON, August 8 (Xinhua) --

President Bill Clinton Saturday vowed to hunt down and bring to justice those who were responsible for the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

"No matter how long it takes or where it takes us, we will pursue terrorists until the cases are solved and justice is done," Clinton said in his weekly radio address.

"To turn our backs on those taking risks for peace, to weaken our opposition to terrorism -- that would give terrorism a victory it must not and will not have," the president said.

The Friday explosions at U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, killed at least 110 people, and the number injured topped 2,200. The 11 Americans were killed in Kenya, along with five Kenyan employees at the embassy.

The State Department has sent medical and other supplies as well as investigators to the two countries. The FBI also dispatched dozens of agents and bombing and evidence specialists there.

Aircraft have taken off from the United States, Europe and elsewhere in Africa bearing medical suplies and other equipment, along with replacement personnel for the two embassies.

A 62-member rescue team, previously sent to the bombed-out federal building in Oklahoma City, Okla., was en route to Nairobi.

U.S. embassies and military installations around the world were ordered to set up barriers and tighten security systems to prevent easy access by unauthorized people -- Americans and foreigners.
