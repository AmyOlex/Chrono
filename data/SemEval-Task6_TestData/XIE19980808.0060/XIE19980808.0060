Cyprus Condemns Terrorist Bombings in Africa





NICOSIA, August 8 (Xinhua) --

The Cypriot government Saturday strongly condemned two terrorist bomb attacks in Kenya and Tanzania Friday, calling them an "atrocious crime."

In a condolence telegram to U.S. President Bill Clinton, President Glafcos Clerides condemned the terrorist acts and extended his sympathy to the victims' families.

Similar telegrams were sent by the Cyprus government to the presidents of Kenya and Tanzania.

More than 100 people have died, eight of them Americans and over 1,000 injured since a bomb ripped through an office building next to the U.S. embassy in Nairobi, Kenya Friday morning.

Six people were also killed and at least 58 injured in a car bomb attack on Friday outside the U.S. embassy in the Tanzanian capital Dar-es-Salaam.

The two bombings happened only minutes apart, apparently with the U.S. embassies as their targets. No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks.
