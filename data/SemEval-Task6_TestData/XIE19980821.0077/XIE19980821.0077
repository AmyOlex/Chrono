NAIROBI, August 21 (Xinhua) --

Director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Louis Freeh said here Friday that U.S. air raid on Afghanistan and Sudan is not directly linked with the probe into the August 7 bombings in east Africa.

"This is an investigation proceeding on many fronts," said Freeh at a press conference at the Jomo Kenyatta airport before returning home. "I cannot detail or characterize the type of evidence we have gathered in Nairobi."

He said he cannot confirm there is any evidence linking the bomb blasts at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania to the Saudi millionaire and the allegedly main sponsor of anti-U.S. terrorism, Osama Bin Laden, who now lives in Afghanistan.

"Hundreds of people have been interviewed" and investigators probably have to take quite a long time to compile evidence in the two bomb blasts so as to reach any conclusion, he said. Freeh flew to Washington immediately after the press conference.

U.S. President Bill Clinton said Thursday that he had ordered the strikes after receiving "convincing evidence" that the terrorist facilities the U.S. raided in Sudan and Afghanistan had played key roles in the bomb attacks in capitals of Kenya and Tanzania.

However, Freeh said although the bombing investigators from the FBI, Kenya and Tanzania have been working very hard and made "very good progress" on the case, so far no conclusion or decision can be made at this stage.

After touring Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam Thursday and meeting with Kenyan police leaders Friday morning, the FBI chief also said that he is very satisfied with the close and effective cooperation among the FBI agents and the police in Kenya and Tanzania.

The man who hurled a grenade at security guards at the U.S. embassy here seconds before the bomb exploded was positively identified Thursday as two more suspects -- one Arab, one Sudanese -- who had been arrested, Kenya's national newspapers reported Friday.

Local sources said that the plan of bombing U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania took three months to complete and bombers destined for Kenya were dispatched through Somalia and Rwanda.

A senior government official who saw the confessions of suspects was quoted Friday by local media as saying that an Egyptian Islamic Jihad group, linked with Laden, planned the attacks.

The car bomb attack at the U.S. embassy in Nairobi killed 253 people and injured 5,000 others.

A nearly simultaneous car bombing outside the U.S. embassy in Tanzania killed 10 people and wounded about 70 others.

Earlier, the U.S.'s demand for Laden's extradition from Afghanistan has been refused by the Taliban government.
