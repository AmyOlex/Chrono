Dividend News: @ CMS Energy Corp. 10/27/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) CMS DIVIDENDS (DIV) EARNINGS (ERN)



CMS ENERGY Corp. said management would recommend to its board today that its common stock dividend be reinstated at a "modest level" later this year. The Dearborn, Mich., energy company stopped paying a dividend in the third quarter of 1984 because of troubles at its Midland nuclear plant. In addition, CMS reported third-quarter net of $68.2 million, or 83 cents a share, up from $66.8 million, or 81 cents a share, a year ago.
