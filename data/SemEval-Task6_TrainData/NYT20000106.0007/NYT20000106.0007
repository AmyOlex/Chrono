EDITORIAL: A DECISION ON ELIAN GONZALEZ

The New York Times says in an editorial on Thursday, Jan. 6: &QL;

The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service made a reasonable decision Wednesday in ruling that Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old boy who survived an ill-fated migrant smuggling trip across the Florida Straits, should be reunited with his father back in Cuba. The decision will inflame anti-Castro Cubans in Miami, but Doris Meissner, the INS commissioner, made it clear that the service had followed established policy in the case. Moreover, by setting a Jan. 14 return date, the immigration service allowed Elian's American relatives time to test the ruling in court.

Elian was one of 13 Cubans who were trying to cross from Cuba to Florida six weeks ago on a 17-foot aluminum powerboat when it capsized. Ten of those on board died, including his mother and stepfather. The boy clung to an inner tube for two days and was plucked from the Atlantic on Thanksgiving Day and brought ashore. He was immediately released into the custody of relatives in Miami _ and just as quickly embraced as a pawn in the poisonous estrangement between Fidel Castro's regime and its opponents in exile.

This page has argued from the start that Elian not be denied due process because of his youth, and the INS appears to have moved carefully. Elian's great-uncle and other American relatives were allowed to make their case that he should have a life in Miami. The boy's divorced father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, was also interviewed and satisfied the agency that he had a close and involved relationship with his son. The mother's parents also argued for a return to Cuba. The INS decided that under their prevailing policies, Gonzalez met the test that calls for custody reverting to the sole surviving parent in such cases.

``This little boy, who has been through so much, belongs with his father,'' Meissner said Wednesday, adding that ``the unique relationship between parent and child and family reunification has long been a cornerstone of both American immigration law and INS practice.'' The White House quickly announced support for the decision.

It is unclear how the political side of this affair will play out. Elian's relatives in Miami have indicated they plan to appeal, as is their right. Some of their more militant supporters in Miami, decrying the prospect that the boy will be used as a ``trophy'' by Castro, have indicated they may try to disrupt efforts to reunite Elian with his father. That would be treating the boy as a trophy in a diplomatic struggle that predates his birth by decades.
