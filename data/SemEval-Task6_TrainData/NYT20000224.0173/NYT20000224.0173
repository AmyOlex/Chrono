MIAMI _

The angry crowd rushed at Manuel Gonzalez as he stepped out of Miami's federal courthouse, shaking fists at him and shouting in Spanish, ``communista'' and ``traitor.''

But the great-uncle of 6-year-old shipwreck survivor rafter Elian Gonzalez only ducked his head and walked faster.

In a drama that has divided his once close-knit family and may finally be resolved in a court hearing the week of March 6, Manuel Gonzalez, 59, a soft-spoken bus mechanic, has remained largely out of the glare of television lights.

Until this week.

He was thrust into the middle of the swirling Gonzalez family saga when Elian's father, Juan Miguel, sent a letter to U.S. Attorney Janet Reno asking that his son be moved to Manuel Gonzalez's home.

Alone among his two brothers and two sisters who have fled Cuba for Miami, Manuel Gonzalez believes Elian should go back to Cuba to live with his father.

Reno denied the request, but Manuel Gonzalez didn't back down.

In a town where expressing even the slightest approval for Cuban President Fidel Castro can prompt threats of physical harm, Manuel Gonzalez filed a motion in federal court asking for custody of Elian so that he could help reunite the boy with his father in Cuba.

It was a move that many see as courageous and principled, but others fear may be foolhardy.

``I have lost a son,'' Gonzalez told reporters later, referring to his own son's death due to cancer. ``I am supporting Juan Miguel because I know what it is to lose a son. Elian should be with his father.''

His sincerity didn't stop the talk on Little Havana's streets or on Miami's ubiquitous Spanish-language radio stations, which buzzed with callers lambasting Gonzalez for playing into the hands of a tyrant.

A day after he was hounded on the steps of the federal courthouse, Manuel Gonzalez wouldn't come to the door of his modest home in Miami's Little Havana.

``He must go to work,'' said his daughter, Rosa, who said Gonzalez would prefer not to talk about the issue. ``There has been a lot of pressure, and he feels this is a family affair.''

After weeks of high-profile public sparring _ with charges of abuse, spying and treachery flying back and forth across the Florida Straits _ it would seem the chances are slim that the Gonzalez family could ever heal the wounds created by the Elian saga.

But the family has overcome steep obstacles before. Long before Elian thrust them into the unrelenting glare of the international spotlight, the Gonzalez clan was a typical example of the conflicts and painful separations wrought by the Cuban revolution.

Of the nine brothers and sisters of Manuel's generation, five have come to Miami, while three remain in Cuba and one has passed away.

According to press reports, Caridad Gonzalez, the oldest sister, was the first to come to the United States, arriving in 1966. Her brother Delfin, who was imprisoned as an anti-Castro activist in the 1960s, followed in 1979. Then came another sister, Georgina, in 1983, followed by Manuel and Lazaro in 1984.

Of those who stayed in Cuba, Juan Miguel's father, Juan Gonzalez, seems the most closely allied with the Cuban government. He worked as a police officer in a Cuban ministry, a position that probably helped his son _ Elian's father _ get a job in the Communist island's increasingly lucrative tourism industry.

The family's experience is like that of thousands of others now split between Miami and Cuba, said Damien Fernandez, a Cuban-American political scientist at Florida International University.

``Cubans value their families above almost anything, but the post-1959 politics have managed to split thousands of families apart,'' he said.

For decades, Cuban Americans in Miami were largely cut off from the families they left behind. Labeled ``worms'' and ``traitors'' by Castro, many weren't able to speak to _ much less visit _ their relatives for years.

The situation began to relax in the early 1990s, with the crisis triggered by the end of the former Soviet Union's subsidies. In desperate need of hard currency, Castro relaxed travel restrictions and allowed Cubans to have U.S. dollars, triggering a trickle of cash from Miami that soon became a flood.

By some estimates, the 700,000 Cubans living in South Florida _ and elsewhere in the United States _ send $1 billion a year in remittances back to their families on the island.

``The Miami families have become a lifeline, and since 1990 there has been a great trend toward reconciliation,'' said Florida International's Fernandez. ``Although many families are still divided by politics, they have learned to forgive and forget and find common ground.''

Prior to Elian, the Gonzalez family apparently was no different. The branches of the family regularly talked by telephone and the Miami relatives went back to Cuba for several family reunions.

But Elian's case has broken down the family's fragile truce, with their political differences exacerbated by the inflammatory rhetoric flying between Castro's government and exile extremists in Miami.

After making his opinions known, Manuel Gonzalez reportedly was ostracized by his Miami kin, especially Lazaro, who has been keeping Elian and who has gone to court to try to keep the boy here.

But there has been at least one attempt at a resolution. The day before last Tuesday's federal court hearing, Manuel went to Lazaro's home to try to work out their differences. Neither side would say what happened, but when Manuel returned to his house, he was so upset he felt heart palpitations and was taken to a hospital.

He was soon released and appeared to be reasonably healthy when he appeared in court the next morning. But while Cuban exiles outside the courthouse cheered Lazaro and his family, their angry taunts seemed to shock Manuel.

His lawyer, however, insists he will continue to stand up for what he thinks is right.

``He's a strong man,'' said Jeffrey Leving. ``He won't let anyone intimidate him from doing what is in Elian's best interests.''

To his credit, Lazaro Gonzalez has issued a statement asking Miami's exiles to respect his brother's opinions.

Manuel Gonzalez has told reporters that he believes his family will recover _ at least partially _ from the divisions Elian's case has brought.

``The wounds of the problem will heal,'' he told the Los Angeles Times newspaper. ``But the scars will always be there.''
